# Data Structures
- Way of organizing info with optimal 'runtime complexity' for adding or removing data
- JavaScript natively implements several data structures. You will be asked about 'inferior' Data
Structures. For example a JS Array vs a Queue.

# Queue - First In First Out
- Queue Class
- Initialize an empty array. Only expose unshift and pop methods.
```
const q = new Queue();
q.add(1);
q.remove(); // returns 1;

class Queue {
  
}

```
