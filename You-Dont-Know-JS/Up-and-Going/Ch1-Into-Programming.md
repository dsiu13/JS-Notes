# Chapter 1: Into Programming

# Statements
- In a computer language, a group of words, numbers, and operators that performs a specific task is a statement in JavaScript.
```
a = b * 2;

```
- The characters 'a' and 'b' are called variables
- 2 is a value itself, called a literal value
- = and * are operators
- The statement a = b * 2 tells the computer to get the current stored value in the variable and then multiply is by 2.
- Programs are just collections of many such statements, which together describe all the steps that it takes to perform your programs purpose.

# Expressions
- Statements are made up of one or more expressions. An expression is any reference to a variable or value, set of variables or values combined with operators.
```
a = b * 2

```
## This statement has four expressions in it:
- 2 is a literal value expressions
- b is a variable expression, which means to retrieve its current value
- b * 2 is an arithmetic expression, which means to do the multiplication
- a = b * 2 is an assignment expression, which means to assign the result of b * 2 expression to var a

- A general expression that stands alone is also called an expression statement. For example: b * 2; This is generally not common or useful.
- A more common expression statement is a call expression statement. The entire statement is the function call expression itself: alert(a);

# Executing a Program
- For some computer languages, this translation of commands is typically done from top to bottom, line by line, every time the program is run, which is usually called interpreting the code.
- For other languages, the translation is done ahead of time, called compiling the code, so when the program runs later, what's running is actually the already compiled computer instructions ready to go.
- It's typically asserted that JavaScript is interpreted, because your JavaScript source code is processed each time it's run.The JavaScript engine actually compiles the program on the fly and then immediately runs the compiled code.
