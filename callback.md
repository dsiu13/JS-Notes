# Callback

- Callback functions are derived from a programming paradigm known as functional programming.
- A callback function is essentially a pattern (an established solution to a common problem), and therefore, the use of a callback function is also known as a callback pattern.

## jQuery Callback
- Note that the item in the click method's parameter is a function, not a variable.
- The item is a callback function
```
$("#btn_1").click(function() {
  alert("Btn 1 Clicked");
});
```
